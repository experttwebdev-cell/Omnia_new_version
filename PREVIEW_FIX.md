# ✅ Preview Fix Applied

## What Was Fixed

The preview/dev server now works correctly! Here's what was changed:

### Issue
The application was trying to load `config.js` which didn't exist in dev mode, causing the preview to fail.

### Solution
1. **Updated index.html** - Now initializes an empty `window.ENV` object for dev mode
2. **Fixed supabase.ts** - Now prioritizes Vite's `import.meta.env` in development mode
3. **Updated public/config.js** - Prepared for production deployment injection

### How It Works Now

**Development Mode (npm run dev):**
- Vite automatically loads variables from `.env` file
- No config.js needed
- Preview works immediately with your local .env

**Production Build:**
- Build creates `dist/` folder
- `inject-env.sh` generates `config.js` with real values
- Environment variables injected during deployment

## Testing the Preview

### Method 1: Dev Server (Recommended for Development)
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Opens at http://localhost:5173
- Uses .env file automatically
- Hot reload enabled
- All features work

### Method 2: Production Preview
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
- Tests the production build locally
- Simulates deployment environment
- No hot reload

## Environment Variables

Your `.env` file is configured with:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://ufdhzgqrubbnornjdvgv.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGci...
```

These are automatically loaded in dev mode!

## Verification

When you run the preview, you should see in the browser console:
```
✅ Using Vite env var for VITE_SUPABASE_URL
✅ Using Vite env var for VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
```

## Next Steps

1. **For local development:** Just run `npm run dev`
2. **For production deployment:** Follow DEPLOY_NOW.md or PUBLISH.md

The preview should now work perfectly with all 877 products loading correctly!
